# 2. Use BEARER token security for APIs

Date: 2021-05-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to authenticate requests to the APIs to ensure that only approved Lead Providers can use them.

## Decision

We will implement BEARER Token security and provide API users with a UUID generated by the service and stored securely

## Consequences

Lead Providers can be identified by their bearer token on each request.

Bearer tokens will need to be generated by the production application.
