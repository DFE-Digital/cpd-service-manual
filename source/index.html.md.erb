title: DfE Continuing Professional Development (CPD)

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This site documents the technical standards and guidance that we expect teams working
within the [Department for Education][1] to follow when building the CPD digital service.

It complements the [DfE Technical Guidance][2], the [GOV UK Service Manual][3] and its
[Technology section][4], which covers service design more broadly.

It is inspired by the [GDS Way][5] and the [Ministry of Justice Technical Guidance][6].

## Overview
Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is owned and operated by the Developing Teachers and Leaders Division (DTLD) a part of the Teacher Workforce Directorate (TWD) within DfE.

CPD encompasses two teacher initiatives namely, Early Career Framework (ECF) and National Professional Qualifications (NPQ) and - as agreed with Mark Wood of the DfE Data Protection Assurance Team - is a national rollout (NRO) aimed at supporting teachers, schools, DfE and providers through the teacher training lifecycle. The digital service will enable users to validate their details against the Database of Qualified Teachers, choose their provision/qualification, report partnerships between providers and schools and enable participants to be set up on the frameworks.

The CPD service is designed to support all future initiatives but initially will only support:

  - Early Career Framework (ECF) Induction programmes (Core Induction Program - CIP and Full Induction Program - FIP)
  - National Professional Qualifications (NPQ)

The processing of data for both ECF and NPQ is considered to have the lawful basis that they are both Public tasks (Article 6 (1)(e)) so that the processing is necessary for the organisation to perform the task in the public interest or for the organisationâ€™s official functions and the task or function has a clear basis in law as shown by the following;

  - [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-statutory-induction-during-national-roll-out][9]

## Users of the service
There are four user groups that require access to the platform in order to perform tasks which contribute to the delivery of the public task.

| Type | Location | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| School Coordinators | External | Responsible for reporting on the school induction programme and any participants in training or induction activities |
| Lead Providers | External | Responsible for delivering training and induction programmes and reporting details on participants progress within those programmes |
| Participants | External | Recipients of training and induction programmes |
| DfE Staff | Internal | Responsible for distribution of funds and reporting effectiveness of policies to ministers |

There are expected to be approximately 46k school users, 90k participants per cohort and 10 lead providers. School users and lead provider numbers will probably not grow much over time but the number of participants will grow by around 90k per cohort of which there are two expected per year.

## Target Architecture
The CPD service comprises a centrally managed reporting platform for all of the interested parties, interactions and use cases supporting the public task.

The platform is developed in Ruby On Rails and is being deployed to GOV UK PaaS as a single network of containerised applications supported by Managed PostgreSQL and Redis DBs. Only UIs and APIs will be internet facing and all data access will be through those interfaces.

If you wish to know more please read [a more detailed description of the technical architecture][12]

## Data
The CPD service is primarily a reporting and funding platform. The service is an authorative datasource on the progress of participants through their training and induction programmes.

  - Participants (ECTs, mentors and teachers) contact details
  - School coordinator contact details
  - Lead Provider organisation information including contact data
  - Delivery Partner organisation information not contact data
  - The associations between schools, participants, Lead Providers and Delivery Partners
  - Participant progression through the course materials trianing course or induction programme
  - Participant activity records
  - Data and metrics required for the justification of contracted payments

If you wish to know more please read [a more detailed description of the domain data][11]

## Authorisation
Schools users are asked to confirm control of the associated email account to add participants and update their contact details.

Lead Providers have their own Learner Management Systems which integrate directly with the reporting APIs to report data for payment calculations and MI, this uses Bearer Authentication tokens managed by the service teams as they are contract managed. It is also possible for Lead Providers to submit report data via a management interface and they are asked to confirm control of the associated email account.

Participants are invited to fill in more details about themselves to faciliate validation against the Database of Qualified Teachers (DQT) before their contact details are passed to the Lead Providers to faciliate onboarding.
