# <%= current_page.data.title %>

In order for external systems to record information such as training progress or outcomes against a participants CPD records a unique identifier (UID) is created. The UID identifier is created by the CPD service.

The Teacher Regulation Agency (TRA) has its own UID called a Teacher Reference Number (TRN). As the TRA is currently responsible for recording the outcomes of inductions the Lead Providers and Appropriate Bodies need the TRN.

In the Early Roll out of ECF and NPQs it was established that the TRN is too basic a format to collect accurately so a decision was made for the digital service to collect and validate the TRN and make available to Lead Providers systems once validated.

## Overview

When a participants induction or training is reported the service collects enough details to match a record in the Teacher Regulation Agency (TRA) records. To do this the service is required to collect first name, last name, email address, TRN, date of birth and optionally National Insurance Number (NINo).

If the TRN or NINo plus date of birth matches a TRA record and at least three out of first name, date of birth, TRN and NINo match then the TRN is considered to have been entered correctly and only the full name, email address and TRN needs to be retained within the service.

If there is no match the participant will be asked to correct their details by comparing them to the [teacher services portal](https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/SelfService/Login) themselves or making a request of the TRA to remind them of their TRN.

## The process of identifying a TRA record for ECF

The following diagram and details helps to explain the processes and systems involved in identifying a TRA record for a participant of the ECF induction programme.

    SIT ->> mECT: Registers participant
    mECT ->> mCPD: Stores contact details
    mCPD ->>+ Notify: Request invitation sent
    Notify -->>- P: Invitation sent

    loop Periodically
      LP ->> API: Contact details (name, email) collected
      API ->> mCPD: Retrieve contact details
    end

    P ->> mECT: Provides teacher record details
    mCPD ->>+ TRA: Validate teacher record details
    TRA -->>- mCPD: Validation result
    mECT ->> mCPD: Stores teacher record details

    loop Periodically
      LP ->> API: teacher details (TRN) collected
      API ->> mCPD: Retrieve teacher details
    end

    LP -->> P: Welcome email sent
```

#### The process in detail

1. the School induction tutor will register contact details for each induction participant in the cohort, which will include name and email address.
2. the contact details are stored by the service to facilitate communications with participants when required
3. an API call with the contact details is made to the GOV UK Notify API service to initiate the invitation email
4. a GOV UK branded invitation email with a one-time use web link is sent to the participants email address
5.
6. the participant follows a the web link in the invitation email and is asked to complete the teacher record details
7. the TRN or NINo plus DoB are submitted to the TRA API to validate the teacher record details
8. the TRA API returns a matched record and the other teacher record details are checked
9. the teacher record details are stored by the service to facilitate manual validation checks if a match is not made

### Simplifying the process for ECF

When a participant moves school during the induction period or a School Induction Tutor has the correct details to hand - such as during the on boarding process - a simpler process is enabled.

The following diagram and details helps to explain the simpler processes and systems involved.
