## Failover / HA Approach
GOV UK PaaS is built to straddle both eu-west-1 (Dublin) and eu-west-2 (London) AWS regions, with clients able to select which region their applications are deployed to.

Within a region, GOV UK PaaS is deployed to 3 availability zones, AZ-a, AZ-b, and AZ-c.  AWS asserts that almost all failures should never affect more than one availability zone at a time.

The system automatically spreads diego cells across all three availability zones.  Most of the APIs and cloud foundry control components are load balanced between 2 of 3 availability zones.

GOV UK PaaS is explicitly scaled to be resilient to a complete failure of any one availability zone.

In the loss of two availability zones, it’s likely that client applications would continue running in the third availability zone, but that the cloud foundry control systems for allowing deployments, gathering logs and so on would be disrupted.
