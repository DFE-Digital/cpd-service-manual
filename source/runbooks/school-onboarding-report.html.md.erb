title: School onboarding report refresh
---

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## Description
There is no current connection from Google datastudio to the management information database so a manual extract needs to be performed and the resulting CSV extract uploaded in order to create a data refresh.

## Caused by
A request to bring the Schools Onboarding dashboard up to date

## Pre-requisits

- You will need to have [set up the Cloud Foundry command line][1]
- You will also need to [sign in to Cloud foundry][2]

## Process

Run the following CLI command to target the `PRODUCTION` space;

```
cf target -o dfe -s early-careers-framework-prod
```

Run following CLI command to perform the extract and create a `prod.csv` file;

```
cf conduit ecf-postgres-production -- psql -c "\copy (SELECT s.name, s.urn, ne.sent_at, ne.opened_at, ne.notify_status, (icp.id IS NOT NULL) AS induction_tutor_nominated, icp.created_at AS tutor_nominated_time, (u.current_sign_in_at IS NOT NULL) AS induction_tutor_signed_in, sc.induction_programme_choice, sc.created_at AS programme_chosen_time, (p.id IS NOT NULL) AS in_partnership, p.created_at AS partnership_time FROM schools s FULL OUTER JOIN nomination_emails ne on s.id = ne.school_id LEFT OUTER JOIN induction_coordinator_profiles_schools icps on s.id = icps.school_id LEFT OUTER JOIN induction_coordinator_profiles icp on icps.induction_coordinator_profile_id = icp.id LEFT OUTER JOIN users u on icp.user_id = u.id LEFT OUTER JOIN school_cohorts sc on s.id = sc.school_id LEFT OUTER JOIN partnerships p on s.id = p.school_id WHERE s.school_status_code IN (1, 3) AND s.school_type_code IN (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 18, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48) AND s.administrative_district_code ILIKE 'E%') to 'prod.csv' csv header"
