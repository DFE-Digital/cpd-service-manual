Performance tests are written in ruby and used to generate JMeter test scripts. The JMeter test scripts are run from a manual CI trigger against a docker compose network that deploys a component with its dependent data stores on the test machine and adds enough test data to enable the test scenarios. The metrics from the test runs is gathered together a a html report is generated and saved as an artifact of each run.
