## Goals
The goal of the testing strategy is to validate that the whole service:

- has only changed in the expected way
- has been deployed into the correct working state
- supports the primary user journeys
- is secure
- is resilient
- does not break any other NFRs

## Stages
Each stage of testing is designed to validate a different part of the service:

### Workspace
Validates that the codebase creates an executable that will function as expected

### Commit to branch
Validates that the executable can be made into a deployable component that will function as expected

### Create pull request
Validates that the executable can be made into a deployable component that will function as expected

### Deploy to PREVIEW environment
Allows the User Researchers to see how real people interact with a specific version of the complete service that will function as expected

### Push to main branch
Validates that the executable can be made into a deployable component that will function as expected

### Deploy to DEVELOPMENT environment
Validates that a specific version of the deployable component can be deployed to an environment along with other components and will function as expected

### Deploy to STAGING environment
Allows the Product Managers / QA to inspect a specific version of the complete service that will function as expected

### Deploy to PRODUCTION environment
Allows a specific version of the complete service to be available to end users and will function as expected
